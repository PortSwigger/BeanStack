<p>Java Fingerprinting using Stack Traces.</p>

<b>Note that this extension sends potentially private stack-traces to a third party for processing.</b>

<h4>Extension Usage</h4>
<p>Browse to a website with a nice stack trace (such as <a href="https://beanstack.io" rel="nofollow">beanstack.io</a>)
and make sure the response passes through the Burp proxy. It should
automatically be picked up, query the API (in the background), and produce an
"Issue" in the Dashboard or Target tab.</p>
